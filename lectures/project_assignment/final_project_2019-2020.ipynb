    "The Allen–Cahn equation (after John W. Cahn and Sam Allen) is a reaction–diffusion equation of mathematical physics which describes the process of phase separation in multi-component alloy systems, including order-disorder transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation describes the time evolution of a scalar-valued state variable $\\eta$  on a domain $\\Omega=[0,1]$  during a time interval $[0,T]$, and is given (in one dimension) by:\n",
    "\n",

    "This equation is the L2 gradient flow of the Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional, and it is closely related to the Cahn–Hilliard equation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The two minima above behave like \"attractors\" for the phase $\\eta$. Think of a solid-liquid phase transition (say water+ice) occupying the region $[0,1]$. When $\\eta = 0$, then the material is liquid, while when $\\eta = 1$ the material is solid (or viceversa).\n",

    "2. Write a function that takes in input a vector of support points of dimension `ndofs` and the degree `degree` of the polynomial basis, and returns a list of basis functions (piecewise polynomial objects of type `PPoly`) of dimension `ndofs`, representing the interpolatory spline basis of degree `degree`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a function that, given a piecewise polynomial object of type `PPoly` and a number `n_gauss_quadrature_points`, computes the vector of global_quadrature_points and global_quadrature_weights, that contains replicas of a Gauss quadrature formula with `n_gauss_quadrature_points` on each of the intervals defined by `unique(PPoly.x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a function that, given the basis and the quadrature points and weights, returns the two matrices $M$ and $K$ \n",
